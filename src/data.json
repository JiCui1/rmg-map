            "description": "In 2007, grace was certified by RMG. The name of the grace comes from the inspiration of three beavers which are located in front of the gallery which represents the beauty, mirth as well as good cheers. Beavers is a strong and very graceful animal which represents by the surrounding of the environment landscape by hard work. Overall, the message from the grace is that hard work is everything to make our goals true.",

            "caption": "Mary Anne Barkhouse is a nationally acclaimed artist, born in Vancouver, British Columbia but with strong ties to both coasts: her mother is from the Nimpkish band, Kwakiutl First Nation of Alert Bay, BC and her father is of German and British descent from Nova Scotia. Barkhouse’s work examines issues surrounding empire, survival, history, and the environment through animal imagery. This work features three beavers sitting atop a piece of granite from the Canadian Shield, which is highly polished. The title grace is influenced by Italian sculptor Antonio Canova’s The Three Graces, depicting three goddesses representing Beauty, Mirth, and Good Cheer. While beavers might not be graceful animals on land, in water they are elegant and efficient. Beavers can reinvent their territory and the surrounding landscape through hard work. By placing these beavers on a piece of the Canadian Shield, Barkhouse places them as valuable players in the ecosystem of Canada’s boreal forest.",

To prepare for his commission proposal, artist Noel Harding attended an Oshawa Generals hockey game. He was inspired by the energy of the crowd and proposed this community-focused work. The shape of the structure, at 19 feet high, is curved, which resembles a megaphone, an amphitheater, a stage, or even a hockey net. It’s covered in mirrored speech bubbles that reflects the enthusiasm of the crowd and brings that energy into a conversation outside of the arena. To further connect the structure outside to the action within the building, a microphone is positioned above centre ice inside that transmits a signal to lights at the base of the steel structure, transforming the sounds into coloured beams of light that are triggered every time the crowd cheers.",
